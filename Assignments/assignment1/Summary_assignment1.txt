The programing assignments share a central theme-creating a mock online store.
The first programming Assignment is about creating an introductory screen that
greets the customer and introduces them to the line of products.
My first programing assignment contains:
A nicely formated greeting message and intrdocutction to line of products 
(3 lines long). The program then, reads a value (coupon number) from the user,
and later displays in the introductory message.
